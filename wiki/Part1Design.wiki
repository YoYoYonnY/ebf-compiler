= New instruction set =

One of the largest problems with brainfuck is the location logic. When programs get large enough it's easy to loose our way and get lots of errors so I thought we introduce variables.

{{{
:a ; defining variable named a
$a ; command to move to th eposition of a
!a ; deallocate variable named a
}}}

== One character variable names ==
There is no point in making this more difficult than it already is. So if we
treat th efirst character as an operator (: $ and !) and the second carcter as the parameter
we can have a table lookup on the ascii value of the character to which the pointer value resides. 

There is also no pojnt in not using a counter that increases for every allocation. this *requires* that we deallocate variables in reverse order as allocation.
