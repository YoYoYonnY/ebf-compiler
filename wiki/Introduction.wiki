=Creating a self-hosting compiler=	
==What I expect you to know to understand this==

I expect you to know elementary brainfuck and I expect you to have
tried to create your own brainfuck programs. You may try some of the links
on this page or google it.

==What is a compiler==
<p>According to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler Wikipedia] it is a program
that converts a high level source code to a lower level source code or
machine code. brainfuck, how I see it, is machine code with readable
instructions so that there is no need for a Assembly language other than 
the instructions themselves. A [http://www.clifford.at/bfcpu/bfcpu.html brainfuck CPU ] design
example is made by Clifford Wolf.


==Has this been done before?==
<p>There are several approaches made by many to create extensions to
brainfuck.
===By changing the language===
<p>Some create extensions in the interpreter/compiler so that you actually
change the CPU. a notable example would be 
[http://www.parkscomputing.com/code/pbrain/ pbrain], where Paul M. Parks
used <tt>()</tt> to enclose procedures and <tt>:</tt> to call them. Which procedure you define
or call was the value of the current cell. Nice idea but it will never run
on any brainfuck CPU/interpreter og even be compiled by any brainfuck to
native/other compiler. (though Tim Rohlfs did write support in his IDE)


===By creating a compiler in perl/c/other language===
<p>You define a language and create a compiler that creates valid and
standard brainfuck code. [http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~couch/bfmacro/bfmacro/ bfmacro]
by Alva L. Couch and  [http://www.clifford.at/bfcpu/bfcomp.html 2 stage compiler bfc=>bfa=>bf] 
by Clifford Wolf. Both of these compile their own invented
extensions to standard brainfuck but non of the compiler are written in
either brainfuck or the language the compiler supports. 

==The aim of this project==
<p>
The aim of this project was to make a self-hosting (written in itself)
compiler and see how I could bootstrap this and how it will eventually
evolve. Beeing [http://www.iwriteiam.nl/Ha_bf_Turing.html Turing complete] there is nothing you cannot implement in 
brainfuck.
